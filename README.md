the .pptx is a file for the slides I made+presented. If you'd rather a google slides link for accessibility, here you go -> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i8wNaKmvec00oMmkf8TQhSlU0S1JywoB-ugog-Mak7s/edit?usp=sharing -----
fuel.csv is initial dataset before cleaning -----
cleanfuel.csv is dataset after cleaning  -----
fuelClean.py is code i used for cleaning. More of an example than what I actually did because it took a ton of running and changing it each time. -----
fuelDTree.py is what was used to run the Decision Tree and make a graph/visual. has extra features commented out like listing attributes by importance and attempts at boosting accuracy
